# 03 – Array Operations

This section covers the most common operations performed on arrays.
These operations form the base for all searching and problem-solving
techniques.

---

## Operations Covered
- Traversing an array
- Updating array elements
- Finding the length of an array

---

## Key Notes
- Traversal means visiting each element once
- Array indices always start from 0
- `length` gives total number of elements
- Updating elements is done using index access

---

## Files in This Folder
- `TraverseArray.java` – Accessing elements one by one
- `UpdateElements.java` – Modifying array values
- `ArrayLengthExample.java` – Using length property

## Important
Time complexity is NOT discussed here.
It will be introduced starting from Linear Search.
