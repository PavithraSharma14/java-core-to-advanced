# 02 – Array Creation, Input & Output

This section covers how to create arrays in Java and perform
basic input and output operations.

These are the first operations expected from any Java developer
working with arrays.

---

## Topics Covered
- Creating arrays
- Initializing arrays
- Taking user input
- Printing array elements
- Traversing arrays

---

## Key Notes
- Array size must be defined at creation time
- Array indices start from 0
- `length` is a property, not a method
- Enhanced for-loop is read-only (cannot modify elements)

- `PrintArray.java` – Output using loops

## Interview Tip
If you confuse `length` with `length()`, it’s an instant red flag.
