# Arrays – Part 1 (Fundamentals)

This part focuses on building a **strong foundation** in Java arrays.  
All concepts here are essential before moving to advanced array algorithms.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Array Basics
- Definition of an array
- Characteristics of arrays
- Memory representation (conceptual)

### 2️⃣ Creation, Input & Output
- Declaring and initializing arrays
- Taking input using loops
- Printing array elements

### 3️⃣ Array Operations
- Traversal
- Updating elements
- Understanding index-based access

### 4️⃣ Passing Arrays to Methods
- How arrays are passed in Java
- Call by value vs reference behavior
- Effects of modifying arrays inside methods

### 5️⃣ Basic Array Problems
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (sorted arrays)
- Find Largest Element
- Reverse an Array
- Print All Subarrays

Each problem includes:
- Clean Java implementation
- Time complexity explanation
- Edge-case awareness

## ⏱️ Complexity Focus
Special attention is given to **time complexity analysis** so that each solution is not only correct, but also optimal.
