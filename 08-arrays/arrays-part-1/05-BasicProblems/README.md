# 05 – Basic Array Problems

This section introduces basic array problems and marks the
starting point for understanding **time complexity**.

The focus is on simple logic and how the number of operations
grows with input size.

## Problems Covered
- Linear Search
- Find Largest Element
- Reverse an Array
- Print Subarrays
- Binary Search

## Time Complexity – First Introduction

Time complexity tells us how the execution time of an algorithm
changes as the size of input increases.

In this section, all problems involve **loop-based traversal**,
so the idea of O(n) and O(n²) naturally appears.

Do not memorize — understand through code.

## Time Complexity Summary

| Problem | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Linear Search | O(n) | Loop may check all elements |
| Find Largest Element | O(n) | Each element is compared once |
| Reverse Array | O(n) | Swaps n/2 elements |
| Print Subarrays | O(n³) | Three nested loops for printing |
| Binary Search | O(log n) | Search space halves each step |
