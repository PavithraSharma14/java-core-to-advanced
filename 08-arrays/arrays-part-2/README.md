# Arrays – Part 2 (Advanced Problems)

This part focuses on **problem-solving patterns** and **optimization techniques** commonly asked in coding interviews.

All problems here build on the fundamentals covered in **Arrays – Part 1**.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Maximum Subarray Sum
Different approaches to understand optimization:

- Brute Force Approach  
- Prefix Sum Optimization  
- Kadane’s Algorithm (Optimal)

Focus:
- Understanding how time complexity improves step by step
- Knowing *why* Kadane’s works, not just memorizing it

---

### 2️⃣ Trapping Rain Water
- Visualizing water trapping between bars
- Using auxiliary arrays / optimized approaches
- Emphasis on space–time trade-offs

---

### 3️⃣ Buy and Sell Stocks
- Identifying minimum buying price
- Maximizing profit in a single traversal
- Real-world greedy pattern
