# Arrays in Java

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures in Java.  
This section is designed to build a **strong, step-by-step understanding** of arrays — from basics to advanced problem-solving patterns used in interviews.

## 📌 What You’ll Learn
- How arrays work internally
- How to create, access, and manipulate arrays
- Common array-based problems and patterns
- Time and space complexity analysis for each problem

## 📂 Folder Structure

Arrays/<br>
├── Part-1/ → Fundamentals + basic problems<br>
├── Part-2/ → Intermediate & advanced array problems<br>


## 🧠 Learning Approach
- Concepts are broken into **small, focused topics**
- Each topic has:
  - Clean Java code
  - Crisp comments
  - README files explaining logic and time complexity
- Emphasis on **clarity over shortcuts**

## 🎯 Goal
To make array concepts **interview-ready**, not just syntactically correct.

➡️ Start with **Part-1** to build a solid foundation.
