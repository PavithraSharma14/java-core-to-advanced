# 2D Arrays – Practice Questions

## 1️⃣ Transpose of a Matrix
Given a 2D matrix, compute its transpose.

### Hint:
- Rows become columns and columns become rows
- Element at position `(i, j)` moves to `(j, i)`
- Result matrix dimensions change from `r × c` to `c × r`

---

## 2️⃣ Diagonal Sum
Find the sum of both diagonals of a square matrix.

### Hint:
- Primary diagonal: `i == j`
- Secondary diagonal: `i + j == n - 1`
- Avoid double counting the middle element

---

## 3️⃣ Row-wise Sum
Given a matrix, print the sum of elements of each row.

### Hint:
- Use nested loops
- Reset sum for each new row
