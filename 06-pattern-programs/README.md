# Java Pattern Programs

Pattern programs help you understand nested loops and logic building.

## 🔁 What are Nested Loops?
A nested loop means a loop inside another loop.

The outer loop controls the number of lines.
The inner loop controls what is printed on each line.

Structure:
for i in rows:
    for j in columns:
        print

Categories:
- Basic patterns (stars, numbers, characters)
- Intermediate patterns (aligned shapes)
- Advanced patterns (butterfly, diamond, hollow shapes)
