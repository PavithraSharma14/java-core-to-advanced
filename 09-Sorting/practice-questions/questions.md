## Problem: Sort an Array in Descending Order

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array, sort the array in **descending order** using basic sorting algorithms.

---

### Input
An integer array  
Example:
[3, 5, 1, 4, 2]

---

### Output
The array sorted in descending order:

[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

---

### Constraints
- Do not use built-in sorting methods
- Focus on modifying existing sorting logic
- Array contains non-negative integers

---

### Objective
This problem helps in understanding how changing comparison logic affects sorting behavior across different algorithms.
