# Sorting Algorithms (Java)

## 📌 Overview
Sorting is a fundamental concept in computer science used to arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending).

This section focuses on **basic sorting algorithms** to build strong foundational understanding before moving to advanced techniques.

Each algorithm is implemented in Java with:
- Clean code
- Clear comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Important interview characteristics (stability, in-place)

## 🧠 Why Learn Basic Sorting Algorithms?
Although basic sorting algorithms are not optimal for large datasets, they are important for:
- Understanding how sorting works internally
- Analyzing time and space complexity
- Building intuition for optimized algorithms
- Answering conceptual interview questions

## 📂 Covered Algorithms

### 1️⃣ Bubble Sort
- Comparison-based sorting
- Optimized to handle the best case (already sorted array)
- Stable and in-place
- Time Complexity:
  - Best: O(n)
  - Average: O(n²)
  - Worst: O(n²)

---

### 2️⃣ Selection Sort
- Repeatedly selects the minimum element
- Not stable by default
- In-place sorting
- Time Complexity:
  - Best / Average / Worst: O(n²)

---

### 3️⃣ Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted array one element at a time
- Efficient for nearly sorted arrays
- Stable and in-place
- Time Complexity:
  - Best: O(n)
  - Average / Worst: O(n²)

---

### 4️⃣ Counting Sort
- Non-comparison based sorting
- Works only for non-negative integers within a known range
- Not in-place
- Time Complexity:
  - O(n + k), where k is the range of elements

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- These algorithms are implemented for **learning and interview preparation**
- They are **not recommended** for large-scale production systems
- Advanced sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort) will be added later

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Implement advanced sorting algorithms
- Compare sorting algorithms based on constraints
- Practice problems that require custom sorting logic
